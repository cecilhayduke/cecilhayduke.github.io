           <h1 id="briefly">Briefly,</h1>

<p>With 20+ years of experience in all phases of technical delivery – from concept through deployment – I bring a wide range of insight to my project teams. I have created solutions for multi-media CD-ROMs, written copy and developed web applications for humanitarian organizations, delivered the web framework and content for the worldwide release of a major operating system, produced campaign experiences for various Xbox entertainment titles, along with both internal and client marketing and brand materials. I value the community aspect of teams working closely together – a process that grows individual skills, strengthens the team, and produces deliverables that exceed expectations and get our clients promotions.</p>

<h2 id="partial-client-list">Partial client list</h2>

<p>In no particular order, I have had the privilege of working with the following companies/teams:</p>

<div class="half">
<ul>
    <li>Microsoft</li>
    <li>Xbox</li>
    <li>Visual Studios</li>
    <li>Nike</li>
    <li>Target</li>
    <li>Amazon</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="half last">
<ul>
    <li>The Seattle Times</li>
    <li>McKesson</li>
    <li>Brooks Running</li>
    <li>World Vision</li>
    <li>Project (RED)</li>
    <li>Major League Soccer</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2 id="unmentionables">Unmentionables</h2>

<p>Along with the abovementioned companies/teams, there have been several projects under strict NDA. And, while I would love to mention them, well… I can’t. Suffice it to say they’re pretty cool, were a lot of fun to work on, and received a fair bit of press coverage.</p>
