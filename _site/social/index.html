           <h1 id="social">Social</h1>

<p>Social can be reduced almost entirely to <a href="http://www.instagram.com/cecilhayduke" title="Cecil Hayduke on Instagram">instagram</a>, though there is rumor of occassional <a href="http://www.twitter.com/cecilhayduke" title="Cecil Hayduke on Twitter">tweets on the twitter</a> (mostly twitter versions of instagram). The <a href="http://www.facebook.com/cecilhayduke" title="Cecil Hayduke on the Facebook">facebook</a> is quite possibly the biggest time-suck — for this reason it has been religated to afterthought beyond being a repository for instagram, twitter, along with the occassional “happy birthday” greeting.</p>

<h2 id="family-social">Family Social</h2>

<p>My family plays <a href="/attributes/" title="the attribute game">the attribute game</a> nearly every day at dinner. The list is from a marriage enrichment exercise — the idea is that each member of the family must come up with an example of how another family member represents the random attribute received. Some are easy. Some take a little bit more thought. It has ended up being a really good family exercise.</p>
