#Social#

Social can be reduced almost entirely to [instagram](http://www.instagram.com/cecilhayduke "Cecil Hayduke on Instagram"), though there is rumor of occassional [tweets on the twitter](http://www.twitter.com/cecilhayduke "Cecil Hayduke on Twitter") (mostly twitter versions of instagram). The [facebook](http://www.facebook.com/cecilhayduke "Cecil Hayduke on the Facebook") is quite possibly the biggest time-suck &#151; for this reason it has been religated to afterthought beyond being a repository for instagram, twitter, along with the occassional "happy birthday" greeting.

##Family Social##

My family plays [the attribute game](/attributes/ "the attribute game") nearly every day at dinner. The list is from a marriage enrichment exercise &#151; the idea is that each member of the family must come up with an example of how another family member represents the random attribute received. Some are easy. Some take a little bit more thought. It has ended up being a really good family exercise.
