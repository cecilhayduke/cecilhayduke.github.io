#Briefly,#

With 20+ years of experience in all phases of technical delivery – from concept through deployment – I bring a wide range of insight to my project teams. I have created solutions for multi-media CD-ROMs, written copy and developed web applications for humanitarian organizations, delivered the web framework and content for the worldwide release of a major operating system, produced campaign experiences for various Xbox entertainment titles, along with both internal and client marketing and brand materials. I value the community aspect of teams working closely together – a process that grows individual skills, strengthens the team, and produces deliverables that exceed expectations and get our clients promotions.

##Unmentionables##

Along with the abovementioned companies/teams, there have been several projects under strict NDA. And, while I would love to mention them, well... I can't. Suffice it to say they're pretty cool, were a lot of fun to work on, and received a fair bit of press coverage.
